>[!note] About
>Wildly resilient with a strong sense of independence, she has a natural charm and charisma that works to do what she knows best; to talk. Her specialty is people, whether it be knowing how to comfort, or knowing what to say to get under their skin. Closeness with others is what she seeks for most desperately, but is also the source of her greatest fear.
>
>She fears betrayal and in extension intimacy, consciously and subconsciously keeping others at a distance, which complicates her ability to form genuine connections. She tends to act rashly, resorting to animalistic like survival instincts in tense situations, causing a self-perpetuation look of forcing people away and reinforcing her belief of only being able to rely on herself.
>
>She is viciously self-critical, and grapples constantly with her perceived inadequacy. Despite these flaws, she remains loyal and determined, aiming to remain strong, wise and invulnerable in the face of stress, believing the reliance on others to be a weakness. She is driven by a craving for adventure.

>[!note] Trivia
>>[!col]
>>> - Her home city/country is very *renaissance Spain and France inspired*, her mother spanish-leaning and her father french.
>>> - Not one to shy away from a fist fight if it comes to it, and even somewhat *enjoys a good tavern brawl*.
>>> - Has the *devil sigh invocation*: She can see in darkness (including magical) as if it were daylight. Because of this, she can't sleep without a blindfold.
>>> - A huge blade nerd; insane about anything dagger or knife related, and has her own dagger collection. She always ensure to have *at least 3 daggers* on herself or within reach, even when she sleeps.
>>
>>>- Alcohol, cigarettes, drugs, you name it; *she will do and take just about anything*, with little to no sense of self-preservation.
>>>- She places *a lot of value in how ‘pretty’ she looks*, believing it to be the one thing about herself she can control that can help excuse her 'unlikable' personality.
>>>- Being an *ex-ballerina*, she is drawn quickly to anything related in arts, and performance, and especially ballet.*She's almost a theatre kid*, having a great interest in many plays, theatrical performances, and dances.
>>>- Can read somewhat okay, and can barely write; she has *hardly legible handwriting*, and usually just gets someone else to dictate her letters for her.

>[!note] Relationships
>|%%t%%|%%t%%||
>|-|-|
>|%%t%%|[[Presna]]|
>|![[image]]|Silver and Presna share a sisterly bond that seems to constantly be antithetical to Presna’s straight-faced demeanour. Presna’s bluntness leads to frustration, as she views Silver as overly emotional and indecisive; something she interprets as weakness. They find themselves arguning more often than not.|
>|%%t%%|[[Langhorne]]|
>|![[image]]|Silver became a sort of surrogate daughter to Langhorne, something that was especially compelling to him after Meldrick had left him years prior. He feels a strong sense of duty with her, feeling the need to become overly-protective and controlling, in fear of the harm that might come if he does not.|
>|%%t%%|[[Meldrick]]|
>|![[image]]|Silver and Meldrick’s relationship is akin to a performative dance; a constant back and forth of cat and mouse play, where the two would constantly switch places as the cat and the mouse. Silver subconsciously took on the role of a healer, desperate to find within Meldrick the second chance that Langhorne thinks he deserves. Silver is mostly unaware what she experienced was abuse, and is likely to frame these stories in such a way that it was her fault he acted the way he did, or is quick to come up with excuses and reasonings for every little action, as though she is wholly afraid to villainise him.|
>|%%t%%|[[Raefa]]|
>|![[image]]|They met not long after Silver found herself washed up on the beach she woke up on, when he came to investigate a campsite her adventuring party had set up nearby his school. She disliked him greatly, then, and it only took about three years of back and forth practical-jokes-turned-pining after that before they even made out for the first time.|

>[!note] Backstory
>*Camille (0-11yrs)*
>Camille Elodie Molina-Toussaint was born to two lower class parents; Olivia and Laurent Molina-Toussaint.
>
>Olivia worked as a seamstress, and her father a fisherman and sailor. They worked tirelessly to support their small family, sinking all of what little money they had into Camille and her future in the performing arts. They compromised any sort of traditional education, her social life, their expenses on food and necessities, all in pursuit of Camille becoming their ‘golden ticket’.
>
>The two worked themselves to near death trying to afford the numerous lessons of the years, using whatever was at their disposal and the contacts from Olivia’s previous life to get as far as they could. The lessons were hours long and tiring, leaving Camille with little time for anything else, all because of her family’s desperate attempt to send her to the best teachers and schools money could buy, to hopefully lead to fame, success and wealth.
>
>Camille, from a very young age, knew what it meant to work. Her father brought in money only when he returned from months of labour at sea, and her mother frequently fell into deep bouts of depression which left her bed ridden on most days. Camille was forced to work to make enough to feed herself and her near-catatonic mother on the week's long stretches without her father, on top of being forced to take on the responsibility of caring for her mother.
>
>Ballet wasn’t enough; it was never enough. Camille would work and train hours a day, days a week, weeks a month, pushing herself to whatever limit her body could take before it physically gave out; and even then, it was hardly enough to feed herself. Years of militaristic training and a series of brutal exams, malnourished and dressed in hand-me-downs, she commonly found herself as one of the many "petits rats" in her industry. It never mattered the role, though, what mattered was the audience.
>
>Camille as a young girl, was subjected to the worst kinds of audience an artist could hope for; the abbonés, subscribers of the theater. Sweat of the performance was met with the gazes of rich men, waiting backstage and in the wings of the alley. Men with swathes of money who paid more than what Camille would see in a year to have the chance to see the girls in their ‘natural habitat’.
>
>Performances were insulted with parties attended by pretty young girls in ribbons and wealthy old men in suits, who thought they had the right to treat the grandeur foyers of the opera like meat markets for the pleasure of their eyes and hands. It was not uncommon to be ogled by voyeuristic strangers, have their hands graze the arch of your lower back, slide up the laddered tights on your bone-thin legs, or have your youth groped from your skin for the promise of staving off starvation. Many of the girls, far worse off than Camille, found their comfortable discomfort in the literal hands of patrons, men who paid for their exclusivity with pouches filled far more than with the others. The more you hated yourself, the more you let things go and the more you fell desperate, the more you'd be paid.
>
>Camille did as little as she could and survived off the bare minimum until her father made it home. And all she got from it was a hatred for the art, juvenile skin tainted by the touch of deviant hands, a handful of coins, and nicotine-stained teeth by the age of 14.
>
>One night, over dinner, Laurent had spoken of a job opportunity that would let his family live comfortably for a reasonable amount of time, but at the expense of Laurent needing to leave for a few months or a few years for the job. Olivia and Camille were upset at the proposition, but the family had no choice but to urge Laurent to take the offer for the betterment of the family. Camille was young, and all she knew was that Laurent was hired by a ship captain to aid him on an expedition, but she knew nothing else. Laurent left not long after, bidding goodbye to his family, before leaving on ship out into the unknown. The Molina-Toussaint family received monthly letters, detailing stories and events written by Laurent, along with a generous amount of money. After 6 months, the letters stopped coming.
>
>Camille never got over her father’s disappearance, and never let it go. Olivia pushed Camille harder, resulting in longer, more grueling lessons and borderline inhumane diets and exercises. Camille decided enough was enough, and determined to find her father, gathered a few belongings, and snuck out into the night and onto the next merchant ship. She moved from ship to ship, dock to dock, asking anyone that would listen to more information about her father, following wild goose chases for years. To make extra money, she worked as dock and ship hands, messengers, ship cleaner, cook hand etc, and was known as ‘Guppy’ by any sailors and workers that knew her at the time after she did not speak for the first few days, and the crew were never able to learn her name.
>
>*Guppy/Tallow (12-13yrs)*
>Eventually, ‘Guppy’ worked their way up to becoming a part of the pirate crew of ‘The Night’s Folly’, and then on became known as ‘Tallow’, affectionately dubbed so by the ship’s head, the nefarious and infamous Captain Halley ‘White Mane’ Langhorne, who had run the pirate crew far longer than Tallow had lived for. Tallow looked up to him, as Langhorne had mentored them in their earlier years on the ship, and became the closest thing to a father figure that Tallow so desperately craved for.. Tallow became quick friends with the crew, and besides the few bouts and violent disagreements here and there, they all still considered each other like brothers. She eventually grew out of her ‘hazing’ names, and formerly became ‘Clove’.
>
>*Clove (18-22yrs)*
>Even though they were apart, Clove frequently and often tried to send letters and money back to her mother, although she never received any in return, likely due to Clove never being long enough in one spot. Her letters themselves are very very infrequent and poorly sent, due to Clove’s fear of her mother’s response, on top of her general lack of ability to concisely read or write. Presna would help transcribe letters for her, but there was only very few she could do before duty calls.
>
>Langhorne had seen her grow, and eventually rarely needed to stand with her hand clenched to his coat for support, and had watched her flourish into an adult, even if she might not have acted as such, the crew giving the name ‘Tallow’ and then eventually ‘Clove’ when she became older and was finally allowed more and more responsibility on the ship as she aged.
>
>Langhorne had watched her go through phases through the years, the most intolerable being what he called her ‘boy crazy’ phase, apparent something every teenage girl goes through, Presna assured. While not limited to just boys, Tallow/Clove had started her habit of falling for and stringing along poor dock workers, bards at the local taverns, sailors from other ships, and just about anyone that even struck her as even slightly her type, and immediately believing she’d "found the one". This led to quite the number of heart breaks on both ends at best, and sometimes landing her in hot water. It seemed like every other month a new partner was introduced to the crew, to the point a lot of them had just entirely given up on trying to remember any of their names or keeping count. ‘Non-committal’, Langhorne would say, ‘Just like her old man,’ the sailors would laugh in response. Eventually, as she grew, Clove kept those affairs more to herself, and mostly gave up on the idea of there being ‘the one’.
>
>Clove was laughably irresponsible and unserious, spending a majority of her time taking life at a slow, carefree pace, enjoying everything life had to offer. This led to some unsavoury habits to be formed, including but not limited to her chronic tardiness, general air of aloofness, and tendency to sneak off frequently against better judgement and instruction to spend her nights at rowdy taverns and the like.
>
>Clove grew more and more impatient as the years went by, very little about her father showing itself during that time. What went from active hunts and help from others started to swindle, as more and more of the leads turned into dead ends and wild goose chases. It seemed all but Clove believed there even was a possibility Laurent was alive, and only she seemed to care to continue searching.
>
>Clove became even quicker and closer friends to Meldrick Brooks, Langhorne’s former apprentice. Meldrick had left for his own adventure after a disagreement with Langhorne, returning a few times and meeting Clove informally then before they properly met and fell in love not long after.
>
>Through years of friendship and plundering at sea, the two became extremely close. Clove adored and looked up to Meldrick. Meldrick loved the attention and spotlight, and was known to be able to sweet talk anyone into doing just about anything. Which in the end, is why Clove believed everything he said and did everything he asked when it came to convincing Langhorne to step down as captain. There came a point where she could not separate her own thoughts from Meldrick’s words, carefully lacing his convictions and half-truths into a noose she would find herself wearing.
>
>Meldrick, in his young adult years, grew to hate his mentor, and vehemently disagreed with how Langhorne ran the ship and the crew, and believed he could do a better job. By extension, Clove agreed with Meldrick, and with him as the brains and charm, the two over several month managed secretly work together (with the help of a few other crew) to trick Langhorne into a trap, getting him arrested by the Monarchy’s Guard and imprisoned for his crimes against the governing body. Taking the reward money, the ship, and the crew, the two ran the ship as Captain Meldrick ‘The Rat’ Brooks, and ‘Maeve’, his trusted right hand, and renamed the ship to ‘The Jewelled Serpent’.
>
>*Maeve (23-35yrs)*
>During their reign of the ship, the two became inseparable. They were two sides of the same coin; Meldrick, for the Maeve of his tongue, and for Maeve, the Maeve of their sword. Together, they made a formidable force, and while some may have called Maeve his ‘lap dog’, as Meldrick’s reputation far preceded hers. But, Maeve wholeheartedly believed they were nothing without Meldrick, and believed Meldrick thought so highly of her as well.
>
>It was during this time that Maeve began to doubt Meldrick, slowly easing her way out of Meldrick’s verbal grasp, and feeling immense guilt for what had become of Langhorne. She never outright fought or disagreed with Meldrick, but his words became less convincing, and pierced less valiantly into her mind. The two became less agreeable and their relationship slowly started to crumble.
>
>The relationship grew more and more abusive as the years went on, Maeve finding herself hardly ever sober, and Meldrick finding himself hardly ever content. Every waking moment, Maeve spent nose-deep or bottle down in whatever made her stop feeling anything at all, walking through the years with little memory and awareness to deal with the constant depreciative words and hands of Meldrick. Her body felt as though it was deteriorating from the inside out, but she also felt invincible; she believed the euphoria of her inebriation was worth the inevitable crash of pain, exhaustion and feebleness that worsened after every use. She didn’t feel human but gods to feel every drop of your blood pump through your heart and every and feel every particle of breath in your lungs made it more than worth it.
>
>Maeve became nothing but Meldrick’s tool, blindingly placated to follow every order and commit every wrong deed, her nervous system far too stimulated in a high to ever think more than once about what was whispered into her ears. She was unstoppable, ruthless, and with little concern for injury or death, in such a way one might have mistaken her for an overly loyal and intelligent flesh golem of Meldrick’s making.
>
>During a plundering of a merchant ship, through orders too ambitious and plans too optimistic, Meldrick sought for an unnamed item that, unfortunately, Maeve was the one to stumble upon. The altercation was brief and barely a fight at all, as Maeve was left to drown within the burning quarters of the ship as Meldrick made off with the prize. She found herself choking on the smoke, and slipping into unconsciousness in a slowly filling room, before she awoke again on a beach in Etricor two years later as ‘Silver’.
