# <u>**My Characters**</u>
>[!missing] %%t%%
>Characters under 'Main' are ones that are *most relevant to me at the moment* and/or *the character I am currently playing in a D&D campaign* or are associated with the character I am playing.
>
>Characters under 'Other' are *older characters/retired D&D characters* that I no longer play but still hold a place in my heart, I'm just not like foaming-at-the-mouth obsessed with them.
