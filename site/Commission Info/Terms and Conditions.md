## **VI.** REVISIONS
- A fee will be added if the client requests something changed on the final drawing, the price depending. 
- If the client wishes for the artist to change something in the drawing the client had been have previously satisfied with, the artist is entitled to charge the client a fee to change it. The amount of the extra charge depends on the change the client requests want me to make.
- The client is limited to 2 rounds of revisions at the end of the sketch, line art, colour flats, shaded, an/or render phase.
> **V.a.** *Sketch* is defined as a drawing containing repetitive or visible construction lines, or very messy lines. These are often early stages of drawings with many stray marks and rough forms.
> **V.b.** *Line Art* is defined as having very little to no visible construction lines. No color or only a single color has been applied to the piece. Attacks with applied overlays and gradients may also fall into this category.

> **V.d.** *Shaded* is defined as the drawing have shading appearing in one or two places, but is not visible throughout the entire piece. One layer of gradient also counts as minimal shading.
> **V.e.** *Render* is defined as the drawing is consistently shaded, and may be influenced by one or more sources of light. The drawing will have a 'painterly' style, likely with visible brush strokes. This is most indicative of the final piece.
