>>[!quote] How do I make good references for my commission?
>>- Keep descriptions concise and to the point; if you're able, divide things into paragraphs, sections, and/or dot points, or even highlight key details
>>- Images, images, images! I can better reference images over lines of text, and the more images provided the better
>>- Existing character references preferred; mood boards, pinterest boards, descriptions, etc are fine, but will increase the price
>>- Pose references preferred, but optional; if you cannot decide on a specific pose, you can give multiple as options/a vibe
